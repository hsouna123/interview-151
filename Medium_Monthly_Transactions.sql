-- Intuition
-- A beginner friendly answer is written by following basic concepts step by step.

-- Approach
-- Looking at the result table we write the basic select statement
-- SELECT ___ as month, country, __ as trans_count, __ as approved_count, ___ as trans_total_amount,___ as approved_total_amount
-- FROM Transactions

-- Now we form the solution column by column, starting from month.
-- As the month column contains only a part (year and month) from trans_date column in Transactions, we use SUBSTR() function to select a substring of trans_date starting from index 1 and going upto 7th index: SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month.
-- We modify the select statement as
-- SELECT SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, __ as trans_count, __ as approved_count, ___ as trans_total_amount,___ as approved_total_amount
-- FROM Transactions

-- Now, we go for trans_count column (as country column is as it is taken from table Transactions), looking at the result table, we need to count the number of transections per month in a country so, we count transaction ids and GROUP them by month and country.
-- The code will look like this now
-- SELECT SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, __ as approved_count, ___ as trans_total_amount,___ as approved_total_amount
-- FROM Transactions
-- GROUP BY month, country

-- Now for next approved_count column, we need to check if the state of transection is "approved" if yes then we count else we don't. For this here we used CASE statement along with SUM() function as follows:
-- SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END).
-- Lastly, modify the select statement by adding:
-- SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count

-- Now for trans_total_amount, as we have already grouped transactions based on month and country so, we can directly write trans_total_amount column as SUM(amount).
-- Now updated select statement will look like this:
-- SELECT SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, ___ as approved_total_amount
-- FROM Transactions
-- GROUP BY month, country

-- As we wrote the condition for approved_count column similarly, we
-- can write for approved_total_amount. The only difference is instead of adding 1, in case the state = 'approved', we add transaction amount: SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END).

-- Thus the final code becomes
-- SELECT SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
-- FROM Transactions
-- GROUP BY month, country

-- Complexity
-- Runtime: 927 ms
-- Beats: 92.67%

-- Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT  SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country
